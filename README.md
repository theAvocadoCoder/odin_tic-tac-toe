## Overview

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a junior developer, I aimed to showcase my understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as encapsulation, factory functions, DOM manipulation, and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE).

## Game Features

- **Player vs Player**: Play against a friend and take turns marking the spaces on the board.
- **Interactive Interface**: Enjoy a user-friendly interface that responds to your clicks, making the gameplay intuitive.
- **Winning Logic**: The game automatically checks for a winner after each move and declares the result.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The structure of the game board and user interface.
- **CSS**: Styling to enhance the visual appeal of the game.
- **JavaScript**: The game's logic and functionality.

## Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Encapsulation**: The game logic is encapsulated within functions and classes to maintain a clean and organized codebase.

2. **Factory Functions**: Factory functions are employed to create instances of the game and manage the state of each player.

3. **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript is used to dynamically manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), updating the UI based on user interactions.

4. **IIFE's (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)**: IIFE's are leveraged to create private scopes for certain functions, preventing variable conflicts and promoting modular code.

## How to Play
