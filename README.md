## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Javascript

### Lessons

The essence of this project was to put to practice my (arguably) newly acquired knowledge of IIFE's, function classes, factory functions, amongst other such topics.

I enjoyed creating the factory functions for the player objects.


### Continued development

This project has confirmed to me that my understanding of functional classes is a little lacking. I would be doing a lot of reading up, as well as more projects to compensate for that deficit.

Despite the page being (technically) mobile responsive, I would have preferred if that responsiveness was more in line with best practices. I believe my failing here to be my lack of skill in the design department. And while I can make no promises to brush up on my design skills, I will be making it a duty to download a design template whenever I embark on a project that gives me that creative freedom.

I would like to pay more attention to my commits and comments. While I recognize that my comments in this codebase are passable and my commits relatively atomic, I believe the room for improvement should be utilized. I understand that comments aid code legibility, while commits, when done properly, improve debugging, task tracking and accountability. As such, I will be more intentional about these in coming projects.

### Useful resources

- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) - I believe this to be one of the most powerful resources currently in my arsenal. It is chuck full of documentation on most programming languages, libraries and frameworks. Plus, it works offline and on mobile
